# Blur2reveal  
A full-stack FastAPI + React platform for token-based image unlocking.

Blur2reveal is a digital content platform where creators upload images with blurred previews, and users can unlock full-resolution versions using tokens. The project includes wallet logic, unlock tracking, secure access control, and a scalable architecture built for future payment integration and cloud storage.
